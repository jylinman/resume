Resume
============

This repository is mainly for my personal resume use and documentation. You can
run `npm run watch` to work on the resume or just `npm run compile` to compile
it once. This repository is made to work with https://github.com/hacksalot/HackMyResume

This repostiory also publishes to jsonresume.org with `npm run publish` and you
can see the actual resume at https://registry.jsonresume.org/albanda You must be
logged in to push to this registry.

```
# Getting started
npm install
npm run compile
npm run publish

# Watching for changes
npm run watch
```
