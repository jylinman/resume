I have been working in the industry from a young age, and have loved every minute of it. Spent much of my career in Los Angeles doing 3D animation, graphic design, and large-scale application development. No matter how much coding I did, there was always room for art. There is something special about being able to create your artwork to be communicative of your message– and then coding it into life.  I have been developing applications for a wide variety of industries such as Gaming, Aerospace, Foreign, Commercial, and User Content Driven. The application mediums have ranged from iPhone development to web development to multitouch tables.  I thrive off finding creative solutions to difficult problems.
